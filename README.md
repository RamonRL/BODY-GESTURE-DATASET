# GESTURE-PROJECT

In this project we can find the main model of my final degree work.

First, a dataset containing 450 sample videos (divided in 10 different subjects) of static and dynamic human gestures. It also contains numpy arrays for every video with frame-to-frame predicted 33 3D coordinates of body joints using MediaPipe BlazePose model.
